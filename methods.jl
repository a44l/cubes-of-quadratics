Returns a matrix whose image is the tangent space to the length(quadratics)-th secant of the cubes of quadrics variety at `quadratics.^3`.
The tangent space is encoded with respect to the basis `monomials(X, 6)` of monomials.

""" `linear_space_equations(A, variables)` 

Takes a matrix A whose image is the linear space and returns a list of linear polynomials in variables `variables` that jointly vanish precisely on the image of A.
`variables` needs to have precisely as many entries as `size(A, 1)`.
